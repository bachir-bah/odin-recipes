    <h2>Description of cake recipe</h2>
    
    <p>Hi, this is a recipe for a vanilla cake. It is a relatively easy recipe
        to follow, and will not take long to make. I hope you enjoy this website
        and recipe!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms 
                with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.ut the excess.</li>
            <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer 
                on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down 
                the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the 
                milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 
                to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. 
                Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
